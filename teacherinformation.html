  Mr. Montanari was born and raised in Wellesley Massachusetts, 13 miles outside of Boston. He grew up in an Irish-Italian household in an Italianneighborhood, although he spent several summers in Galway, Ireland with his mom’s side of the family. The family church was St. Paul Church, where his parents were married and he was baptized. Later in life, Mr. Montanari married his wife, Dana, there and both of his boys (Spencer – 10th grade and Paddy – 4th grade) were baptized there as well. He was also an Altar Server at St. Paul Church for many years. In 1991, Mr. Montanari moved to Seattle, headed back to Boston in 1994, and eventually settled back in Edmonds in 2002. He has been a parishioner of Holy Rosary ever since.
  Mr. Montanari has an AE in Architectural Engineering Technology from Wentworth Institute of Technology, a BS in Earth Science & Secondary Education from Framingham State College, and a Masters in Marine and Environmental Affairs from the University of Washington. He began teaching in 2000 and has taught middle school children in several school districts in the area and in Boston. Prior to becoming a teacher, Mr. Montanari worked for 14 years in the heavy construction industry, mainly in construction estimating and sales.
  Along with his wife and children at home there are four fish, three cats, one rat, one hamster, and his personal favorite, Betsy, the 4-year old black lab. When not teaching, Mr. Montanari likes working in his yard, camping, traveling, cooking, and enjoys playing ice hockey, which he has done for over 25 years. Lastly, he loves the Boston Red Sox!
